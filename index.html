            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or
                system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification
                in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a
                design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in
                craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Philosophy of design is the study of definitions of design, and the
                assumptions, foundations, and implications of design. There are also countless informal or personal
                philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary,
                both between different schools of thought[which?] and among practicing designers.[22] Design
                philosophies are usually for determining design goals. In this sense, design philosophies are
                fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. For example,
                reflections on material culture and environmental concerns (sustainable design) can guide a design
                philosophy.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Design as a process</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields,
                whether amateur or professional, alone or in teams, produce designs.Kees Dorst and Judith Dijkhuis,
                both designers themselves, argued that "there are many ways of describing design processes" and
                discussed "two basic and fundamentally different ways", both of which have several names. The
                prevailing view has been called "the rational model", "technical problem solving" and "the
                reason-centric perspective". The alternative view has been called "reflection-in-action",
                "co-evolution", and "the action-centric perspective".</p>
